# SIT374 Upskilling Project 1 (Week 3)

Upskill project following this video: https://youtu.be/wYpCWwD1oz0

**Highlight:**

- React.js framework
- Sidebars with React Pro Sidebar
- Page layout with Mui Material (Box, Typography)
- Tables with Mui Datagrid
- FullCalendar & Customisation
- Line chart, bar chart, pie chart and geography chart with Nivo Chart package

### Justification:

This website project is similar to what I am going to create in the actual Sport
Performance Project: a dashboard that displays relevant data and graphs. I can
apply my learning from this project, React.js and data/graph libraries
specifically, to the project I will be working on later this trimester.
