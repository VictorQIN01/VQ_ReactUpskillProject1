# SIT374 Upskilling Project 1 (Week 3)

Upskill project following this video: https://youtu.be/wYpCWwD1oz0

**Up-skilling Highlight:**

- React.js framework
- Sidebars with React Pro Sidebar
- Page layout with Mui Material (Box, Typography)
- Tables with Mui Datagrid
- FullCalendar
- Line chart, bar chart, pie chart and geography chart with Nivo Chart package
- Component customisation (Mui, Nivo Chart, Fullcalendar)

### Description:

In this up-skilling project, I created a web-based dashboard app following a YouTube video. The application is created using React.js framework and some packages to visualise data (Mui, NivoChart). In addition to the video tutorial, I made some changes to the styling and layout of the web application to ensure the responsiveness and consistency of styling and theme of the webpage (e.g., making the position of sidebar fixed while maintaining the original layout of topbar and main section, changing the hover effect of some component).

### Justification:

This website project is similar to the solution that I am going to create in the actual Sport Performance Project: a web-based dashboard that displays relevant data and graphs. I can apply my learning from this project, React.js and data/graph libraries specifically, to the project I will be working on later this trimester.
